  <h2>Benefits of Solar Cooking</h2>
  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card"><h3>Zero Operating Cost</h3><p>A solar oven uses sunlight instead — the sun doesn't send a bill! Once you have the oven, every meal cooked with it has zero fuel cost. Sources like Solar Cookers International, Wikipedia, and various eco/expert sites emphasize this: "Solar cooking has zero cost for fuel" and "cost nothing to operate."
No electricity or gas consumption — No plugging in, no gas connection, no meter running. This makes it truly free to run during sunny hours, ideal in sunny Kathmandu (plenty of clear days year-round, especially Oct–May).</p></div>

    <div class="card"><h3>Reduces deforestation</h3><p>They cook using free solar energy—no wood, charcoal, or other biomass needed. When a household uses a solar oven for one or more meals (especially lunch on sunny days), they burn less or no firewood for those meals.</p></div>
    <div class="card"><h3>No external fuel dependency</h3><p>In places with unreliable LPG/electricity or high fuel costs, sunlight is truly "free forever" after the initial setup.</p></div>
