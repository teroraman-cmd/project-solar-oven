# DIY Box Solar Oven / Solar Cooker

<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x450.png?text=DIY+Box+Solar+Oven" alt="Completed solar oven" width="800"/>

Build your own no-fuel solar oven that can bake, boil, stew and roast using only sunlight.

Tested designs regularly reach **130–165 °C** in strong sun (Kathmandu / similar latitude & altitude performs very well Apr–Oct).

## Features

- Double-glazed transparent lid
- Good insulation → holds heat even when sun is partly blocked
- Adjustable external reflector → boosts performance ~30–60%
- Can cook for 4–6 people
- No electricity needed
- Great for off-grid, camping, emergencies, eco-living

## Two Versions

| Version              | Difficulty | Cost est. | Max temp (good sun) | Build time | Best for             |
|----------------------|------------|-----------|----------------------|------------|----------------------|
| Basic Pizza-box      | Very easy  | $5–15     | 80–110 °C            | 1 hour     | Kids, demos, testing |
| Real Cooking Box     | Moderate   | $40–120   | 130–165 °C           | 1–2 days   | Serious cooking      |

This repo focuses on **Version 2 – Real Cooking Box**.

## Materials

### Box & Insulation
- Plywood or OSB: 12–18 mm thick (~120×80 cm sheet)
- Rigid insulation foam (XPS / polyiso): 40–60 mm thick (~2–3 m²)
- Aluminum foil tape or reflective mylar emergency blanket
- Flat black paint (non-toxic, heat resistant) or black poster board

### Glazing
- Tempered glass or polycarbonate sheet 4–6 mm thick (≈ 60×60 cm) × 2 sheets
  OR double glazing unit if you can source cheaply
- High-temperature silicone sealant

### Reflector
- 4–6 mm plywood or hardboard (~100×100 cm)
- Mylar / aluminum foil (shiny side out)
- Hinges + angle bracket / strut to adjust angle

### Cooking Pot
- Blackened thin-walled metal pot with tight-fitting lid (cast iron or dark aluminum)
- Optional: black pot cozy / haybox for extra heat retention

### Tools
- Jigsaw / circular saw
- Drill + bits
- Screwdriver
- Measuring tape, square
- Utility knife
- Staple gun (helpful)

## Dimensions (example – scalable)

- Outer box: 70 × 70 × 35 cm (W×D×H)
- Inner cooking chamber: 50 × 50 × 20 cm
- Glazing area: 55 × 55 cm
- Reflector panel: 80 × 80 cm

## Step-by-Step Build Instructions

1. **Build the insulated outer box**
   - Cut plywood → bottom + 4 sides
   - Cut insulation foam to fit inside snugly
   - Glue / screw foam inside the plywood box
   - Line the inner faces of the insulation with aluminum foil (reflective side facing in)

2. **Create inner cooking chamber**
   - Build a smaller plywood / cardboard box that sits inside (or directly line the insulation)
   - Paint inside completely flat black (absorbs best)
   - Leave ~3–5 cm air gap between inner chamber and outer walls for extra insulation

3. **Make the glazing lid**
   - Build a simple frame (wood or aluminum) that fits on top of the box
   - Install first sheet of glass/polycarbonate → seal edges with silicone
   - Add 10–20 mm air gap → install second sheet
   - Seal very well — air leaks kill performance
   - Add weather-stripping / felt on the box rim so lid seals tightly

4. **Add reflector panel**
   - Cut plywood/masonite square
   - Cover one side completely with stretched, smooth mylar or foil
   - Attach to back/top edge of box with hinges
   - Add adjustable prop (stick / threaded rod + wingnut) so you can tilt reflector 0–60°

5. **Final touches**
   - Paint outside of box white / silver (reflects sun, stays cooler)
   - Add carrying handles
   - Optional: small thermometer port (drill hole + cork)

## How to Use

1. Place in direct sun (no shadows)
2. Face box toward sun; adjust reflector so bright spot falls on black pot
3. Every 30–60 min: re-orient box + reflector (or use manual tracker)
4. Put food in black pot → place in center → close lid tightly
5. Cooking times (full sun):
   - Rice / lentils     1.5–3 h
   - Vegetables         1.5–2.5 h
   - Bread / cake       2–4 h
   - Chicken / stew     3–5 h
   - Water pasteurization  1–1.5 h @ ≥65 °C

## Performance Tips

- Best results when ambient temp > 20 °C
- Use dark, thin metal pots (cast iron works but heats slower)
- Pre-heat pot if possible
- Never open lid unnecessarily — each opening drops temp 20–40 °C
- Add a black metal plate under pot to absorb more heat

## Safety

- Glass gets **very hot** — use gloves
- Do not leave children unattended
- Do not cook meat/fish below 74 °C for long periods (use thermometer)
- Reflector can cause eye damage — do not look directly at bright reflection

## Variations / Upgrades

- Add small fan + PV panel for air circulation (improves evenness)
- Parabolic booster reflector (more complex)
- Tracking mount (Arduino + servos — see other repos)
