  <h2>Real-Life Impact & Inspiring Stories</h2>
  <p>Solar ovens do more than cook food — they transform lives, protect the environment, and build resilience in communities around the world. Here's how they're making a real difference.</p>

  <h3>Key Benefits & Environmental Impact</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Healthier lives</strong>: Reduces indoor air pollution from open fires, which kills over 1,250 children under age 5 daily (source: Solar Cookers International).</li>
    <li><strong>Protects forests</strong>: One solar cooker can save up to 1 ton of wood per year, helping prevent deforestation in fuel-scarce regions.</li>
    <li><strong>Climate action</strong>: Millions of solar cookers already prevent millions of tons of CO₂ emissions annually — equivalent to taking hundreds of thousands of cars off the road.</li>
    <li><strong>Saves money & time</strong>: Families spend less on fuel (sometimes $90+ per year per cooker) and women & children gain hours for education, work, or safety instead of gathering firewood.</li>
    <li><strong>Safer cooking</strong>: Reduces risks of violence during firewood collection and burns from open flames.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Success Story: Kakuma Refugee Camp, Kenya</h3>
  <p>In the Kakuma Refugee Camp and Kalobeyei Settlement (home to ~298,000 refugees), Solar Cookers International (SCI) has distributed hundreds of sturdy solar cookers since 2018. These cookers last 15+ years and serve families of 6–10 people.</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>“It [the solar cooker] has been a lifesaver. I could not afford fuel or barter food for fuel, and my only choice was to risk being attacked while collecting firewood.”</p>

  </blockquote>

  <ul>
    <li>400+ solar cookers distributed → impacted 3,120+ refugees directly</li>
    <li>Over 42 million solar-cooked meals served</li>
    <li>~8,940 metric tons of CO₂ avoided over the cookers' lifetimes</li>
    <li>93% of participants report using less fuel and saving money</li>
    <li>Women have become solar cooking champions, leading training and follow-up in their communities</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Global Reach & Bigger Picture</h3>
  <p>More than 4 million solar cookers have been identified worldwide, directly improving life for over 14 million people. If just 25% of meals were solar-cooked in fuel-reliant households, it could prevent 170 million tons of CO₂ emissions annually and save billions in health & environmental costs.</p>

  <p>From refugee camps in Kenya to rural communities in Chad, Mexico, and beyond — solar cooking empowers people, saves trees, reduces emissions, and creates safer, healthier futures.</p>
