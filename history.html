  <h2>History of Solar Cooking</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>:1767: Invention of the first solar oven — Swiss scientist Horace-Bénédict de Saussure built the world's first functional solar cooker, a "hot box" design with nested glass layers over an insulated black-lined box to trap heat via the greenhouse effect. It reached temperatures up to around 110°C (230°F) and was used to cook food and heat drinks, laying the foundation for modern box-style solar ovens (though his main goal was studying solar heat, not primarily cooking).</li>
    <li>: 1830:Early practical demonstrations — British astronomer Sir John Herschel used a similar hot-box solar cooker during an expedition in South Africa to successfully cook meals, proving the concept in real-world field conditions and popularizing the idea in scientific circles.</li>
    <li>1860s–1870s: Development of concentrating designs — French mathematician Augustin Mouchot created early parabolic solar cookers and engines, focusing sunlight intensely for higher temperatures (used by French troops in Africa). In 1876, W. Adams in India built an octagonal glass-enclosed oven with mirrors, one of the first panel/reflector types capable of efficient cooking in sunny tropical climates.</li>
    <li>1940s–1950s: Modern designs and renewed interest — Hungarian-American inventor Maria Telkes developed practical insulated box solar ovens with reflectors in the 1940s–1950s, funded partly by grants for fuel-scarce areas; her designs emphasized affordability, portability, and versatility (baking, boiling, roasting). Around the same time, parabolic types like George Lof's "Umbroiler" emerged, and testing expanded in places like Mexico and India.</li>
