  <h2>How a Solar Oven Works</h2>
  <p>Concentrating/Reflecting Sunlight — Reflective surfaces (like aluminum foil, mirrors, or polished metal) bounce and focus sunlight rays onto a specific area, usually the cooking pot. This increases the intensity of the light hitting the target, much like using a magnifying glass to start a fire (but safer and broader).
Converting Light to Heat (Absorption) — The cooking vessel (pot or pan) is typically painted matte black inside and out. Black surfaces absorb almost all incoming sunlight and convert it efficiently into heat energy, rather than reflecting it away. (Light colors would bounce the rays back out.)
Trapping/Retaining Heat (Greenhouse Effect + Insulation) — A transparent cover (glass, clear plastic, or acrylic) lets sunlight in but blocks much of the infrared heat from escaping — creating a mini-greenhouse effect. Insulation (foam, cardboard, or other materials) around the sides and bottom reduces heat loss through conduction and convection. This allows temperatures inside to build up steadily, often reaching 120–165°C (250–330°F) in good sunlight for box types, or even higher (up to 800–1000°C) in concentrating designs.</p>
